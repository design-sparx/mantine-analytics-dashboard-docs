## Introduction
Hello! I trust you'll find this theme valuable. The dashboard template, built using Mantine UI, offers new components
and styles beyond the official ones. While the demo pages are additional and won't replace the official ones, they
showcase the theme's features clearly. The documentation explains the theme's structure, customization, and altering
the source code to suit your requirements.

The documentation helps you grasp the theme's organization, guides you in compiling and expanding it to suit your needs,
and shows how to modify the source code.

## Something missing?
If you notice any gaps in the documentation or encounter confusion in certain sections, kindly reach out to us via
email at ([kelvin.kiprop96@gmail.com](mailto:kelvin.kiprop96@gmail.com)) with your suggestions for enhancement. We
greatly value your feedback and look forward to hearing from you!
